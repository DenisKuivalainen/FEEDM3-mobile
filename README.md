### Application logic

##### User side

When creating a project, I pursued to create a simple and intuitive interface for the user so that it was possible to use the web application easily and without instructions.

All input fields and results are rendered depending on the data already entered.

##### Server side

The server part is described in [the source at the link](https://github.com/DenisKuivalainen/FEEDM3/blob/master/README.md).
